# OBJ - Wavefront object file
# the javagamebook loader only understands these commands:
#   mtllib <filename>    - load materials from an external .mtl file
#   v <x> <y> <z>        - define a vertex with floating-point coords (x,y,z)
#   f <v1> <v2> <v3> ... - define a new face. a face is a flat, convex polygon
#                          with vertices in counter-clockwise order.
#                          positive numbers indicate the index of the vertex that
#                          is defined in the file. negative numbers indicate the
#                          vertex defined relative to last vertex read. for
#                          example, 1 indicates the first vertex in the file,
#                          -1 means the last vertex read, and -2 is the vertex
#                          before that.
#   g <name>             - define a new group by name. the following faces are
#                          added to the group.
#   usemtl <name>        - use the named material (loaded from a .mtl file)
#                          for the faces in this group.
